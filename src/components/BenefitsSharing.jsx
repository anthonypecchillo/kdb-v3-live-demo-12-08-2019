      <strong>Benefit sharing mechanisms</strong>
      <li>
        Increasing productivity of degraded areas as a way of reducing pressure on forestlands and
        generating income;

        1. Describe the broad picture of how REDD program addresses social and economic well-being
        of forest dependent communities
      </strong>
      <br />
      The IES-Carbon Program is founded on the concept of incentives for environmental services
      (IES), which are defined as the costs of actions and interventions that result in the
      maintenance and/or increase in the provision of environmental services. The program is founded
      on the belief that this approach is essentially dealing with poverty reduction. Incentives are
      designed to increase the income and productivity of agricultural and forestry production
      systems, which, in conjunction with increased command-and-control measures, will lead to
      reduced pressure on forests, thereby assuring the continued provision of environmental
      services.
      <br />
      <br />
      The IES differs from the payments for environmental services (PES) concept because the service
      provider is not being remunerated for the environmental service. The service provider is
      receiving resources that allow him/her to redirect his/her land use toward a more sustainable
      model.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>
        2. Description of the PES or benefit sharing mechanisms currently in place or planned
        (concrete elements)
      </strong>
      <br />
      The Program has established guidelines for the development of REDD actions within the state
      that differ for distinct social and/or cultural groups. The IES are proposed to offset either
      entirely or partially the costs of actions including:
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Increasing productivity of degraded areas as a way of reducing pressure on forestlands and
        generating income;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Forest protection as a strategy to diminish the risks associated with forest degradation;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Forest protection as a strategy to diminish the risks associated with forest degradation;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Restoration of degraded areas through reforestation and establishment of agroforestry
        systems, restoring environmental services and producing economically valuable forest assets.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <br />
      The value of the incentives will be determined in the context of each sub-program or project
      through a process of consultation and participatory design with the stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Company responsible for implementation of the IES-Carbon Program shall take into account
      the result of the consultation on the Carbon PES proposal which led to creation of the IES
      Carbon Program and the SISA, however, considering the various circumstances of the potential
      beneficiaries, in the design of sub programs, plans of action and ad hoc projects, mechanisms
      should be developed in a participatory manner with the beneficiaries of environmental services
      providers upon design of the individual actions.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>
        3. Describe evidence of participation of stakeholders in the development of the mechanisms
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The multi-stakeholder consultation process included discussions on the possible activities
      that could be supported within each incentive as well as the range of values these incentives
      should span. The Climate Change and Environmental Service Regulation Institute (IMC) is
      responsible for regulating the IES Carbon Program and shall develop additional rules for the
      preparation of the Terms of Reference for the development of sub programs and ad hoc projects
      considering principle X of Law #2308/2010 on transparency , efficiency and effectiveness in
      the management of funds, with social participation in the development, management, monitoring,
      assessment and review of the system and its programs.&nbsp;
